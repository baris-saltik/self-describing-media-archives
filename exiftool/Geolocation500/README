ExifTool Geolocation database files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The built-in Geolocation feature of ExifTool includes cities with
populations greater than 2000 without language support.  This package
enhances this ability to include cities with populations greater than 500
and adds support for alternate city names and language translations.

To install these files, and add an entry in the ExifTool config
file pointing to this directory:

  $Image::ExifTool::Geolocation::geoDir = '/PATH/TO/DIR';

where "DIR" is the directory containing this README file, Geolocation.dat,
AltNames.dat and the GeoLang directory.

Alternately, Geolocation.dat, AltNames.dat and GeoLang may be copied into the
same directory as the lib/Image/ExifTool/Geolocation.pm module.

These database files are based on the Creative Commons databases provided by
geonames.org.  See https://exiftool.org/geolocation.html for more details,
and the comments in lib/Image/ExifTool/Geolocation.pm for a description of
the database format.
